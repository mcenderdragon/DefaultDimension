# DefaultDimension
Minecraft Mod to change the default (re)spawn Dimension


# Features
This mod is quite simple: in the config you change the default dimension to the dimension you want and all players will spawn in there. Some mods are dimensions where you ran respawn in (and use a bed there) players will also respawn there and will not ported back. This also adds a dimensional spread command to spread players across diffferent dimensions.
Usage:
    ``/spreaddimensional <player> <dimensions>``
*dimensions* is a string in " quotes different dimensions are seperated by comma ",".
Example: 
	``/spreaddimensional @a "overworld, the_nether"``

## Example config:
if you change the default dimension to the nether you will spawn in there. If you die in the end you will get ported to the nether again, but if you die in the overworld since you have a bed there you will also respawn there.
